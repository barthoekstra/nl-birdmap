## Structure of this repository
This repository is organized around three key scripts:
1. `radar-profiles.Rmd`: Derives flight altitudes from vertical profile radar data. Produces Figure 1 of the manuscript.
2. `birdmap.Rmd`: Contains the processing from identified peak nights to the peak night distributions of migratory birds across the Netherlands, and the subsequent analysis of wind power-bird migration tradeoffs. Produces figure 2 and 3 of the manuscript.
3. `rbc_preprocessing.R`: Performs computationally intensive pre-processing of radar data to correct for range bias. Best run independently before executing `birdmap.Rmd`.


## Data
This repository contains all data needed as initial input data, or GIS data to recreate the figures. Unfortunately, given the large data volume of weather radar data, it is impractical to share this here, but the data is freely available via the [KNMI open data portal](https://dataplatform.knmi.nl/) and can be accessed via the new [{getRad} R package](https://aloftdata.github.io/getRad/). The analysis notebooks show how files should be structured for the analysis and the folder structure has been retained by adding empty `.gitkeep` files to this repository.

A short summary table with of input files, their contents and sources is listed below. All files are located in `data` and the respective subfolders. A dash indicated in the source column indicates the data is created for the purpose of this study.
